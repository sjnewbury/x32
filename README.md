# x32 porting

This overlay contains all my efforts to port a complete GNU/Linux
userspace including desktop/workstation GUI software.

It's a work in progress.  Some ports are incomplete, or even
broken.

If anybody wants to assist, please take up the challenge!

If you want to sponsor this effort, and ensure I keep at it,
please contact me.
